#2d roguelike

Starting with a demo unity project I re-specced this to have a more flexibile object instantiation process and a smarter enemy AI

##Setup
* Requires Unity 5
* Should be good to go with all assets

##Known issues
* Enemy AI can still get into weird states at high levels
* After level 300 board instatiation goes a bit haywire. This would require several hundred hours of straight play to reach, so seems unlikely to be noticed
